# Product roadmap

pcbex has completed the first production-pipeline roadmap. Each milestone was
integrated through a focused pull request and published as an independently
auditable release.

| Release | Capability | Operational outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1.297.0 | Integrated KiCad analysis | One deterministic analysis bundle and manifest |
| v1.298.0 | Bundle comparison | Baseline regression gates for quality and violations |
| v1.299.0 | GitHub Actions reporting | PR summaries, SARIF, and retained evidence artifacts |
| v1.300.0 | Versioned DFM profiles | Stable fabrication constraints and aliases |
| v1.301.0 | MCP server | Agent-facing bounded hardware-analysis tools |
| v1.302.0 | Asynchronous MCP tasks | Pollable, cancellable long-running operations |
| v1.303.0 | Placement candidates | Deterministic Pareto placement portfolios |
| v1.304.0 | Routing candidates | Deterministic Pareto routing portfolios |
| v1.305.0 | Schematic IR | Closed KiCad schematic import boundary |
| v1.306.0 | Electrical approval | Policy-controlled deterministic schematic gate |
| v1.307.0 | Simulation evidence | Artifact-bound, simulator-neutral measurements |
| v1.308.0 | AI schematic approval | Evidence-constrained review with Ed25519 signatures |
| v1.309.2 | Release audit | Machine-checked roadmap, assets, checksums, and protection |
| v1.310.0 | Installation doctor | Machine-readable local and CI readiness diagnostics |
| v1.311.0 | Capability inventory | Versioned discovery for commands and integration contracts |
| v1.312.0 | Electrical rule explanations | Policy-bound triggers and remediation for every finding |

`ROADMAP.json` is the canonical machine-readable milestone ledger. The release
audit rejects duplicate or unordered milestones, a version mismatch, missing
tags, malformed release metadata, missing or extra assets, invalid SPDX JSON,
and archive checksum mismatches. An optional repository audit also verifies
that `main` has strict required checks, linear history, conversation
resolution, and force-push/deletion protection.

The next roadmap should focus on production adoption: reusable fab profile
distribution, organization policy packs, review-provider adapters, and
manufacturing feedback ingestion. Those are intentionally not marked complete
until each has an executable acceptance contract and its own release.
